## RDBMS 
RDBMS stands for relational database management system. it is based on the relational models given by E. F. Codd., there are few relational database models , they are table, fields, rows, columns etc., RDBMS is stored in database objects.
Relational database organizes data into tables which can be linked or related based on data common to each. This capability enables you to retrieve an entirely new table from data in one or more tables with a single query. It also allows you and your business to better understand the relationships among all available data and gain new insights for making better decisions or identifying new opportunities.

## SQL
We can communicate with relational databases using Structured Query Language (SQL), the standard language for interacting with management systems. SQL allows the us to join the tables using a few lines of query.
With SQL, analysts do not need to know where the order table resides on disk, how to perform the lookup to find a specific order, or how to connect the order and customer tables. The database compiles the query and figures out the correct data points.SQL helps us to retrive large amount of data within few seconds.SQL helps us to calculate math functions like sum, agg, avg ect.
